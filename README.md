Hey all!

I've made my first step into the world of Git Hub as Ive just started my journey in uni where I hope ot make great strides towards my career as a Dev!

Will be working through my knowledge of Python and then into Java as these are the two languages that my course want me to use, but may also venture i0nto snippets of other things when I come across a use for them!
